# Clear sky index interpolation
# 0. Get GHI from satellite data
# 1. We average the positional data of the ship to the hourly data from the satellite to get 1-hour resolution positional data
# 2. Get clear sky model (CAMPS)
# 3. Divide GHI from satellite data by CAMPS model : satellite_data / CAMPS = clear_sky_index (1 hour resolution)
# 4. Interpolate GHI from satellite data to 1-minute resolution
# 5. Multiply interpolated 1minute clear sky index by GHI from satellite data in 1-minute resolution
# 6. Add interpolated GHI from satellite data and clear sky GHI

Cannot do the 3D interpolation the way we wanted because the ship is continuously moving erratically (changing speed and direction) at a rate of (in average) 0.1428 degrees/hour, while our hourly satellite grid resolution is of 0.05 degrees, so averaging the location of the ship hourly would give wildly innacurate results for the satellite pixel size.

In order to interpolate our satellite GHI and upsample the data from 1-hour to 1-minute resolution using the clear-sky model we need accurate latitude and longitude positions in order to match our minute-data from the ship measurements by correlating the position with the clear-sky model. 

----------------
After meeting Saturday:

- Reformat the satellite dataframe to 3D: Time, each time with: lat, lon, irradiance
- 3D interpolate daily data of satellite by latitude, longitude and time to 1-minute data of the ship.
