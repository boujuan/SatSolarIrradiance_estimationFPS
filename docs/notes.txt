- Plot satellite heatmap
- Find acoustic doppler data from ship data.
- Plot one against each other. (pyromiter ground data vs doppler (and against satellite))

Timeseries plot of the two, two y axis. Interactive plot.

DOPPLER DATA: Acoustic timescatter

--------------------------------
HTTP Scrap data of valid timerange from https://osi-saf.ifremer.fr/


Rgi function (regular grid interpolator)
lat from +60 to -60, lon from -150 to -10
Interpolate a single point inside the grid.

Interpolate satellite data also from time doman (60min->1min)
(3D interpolation)

---------------------------------

- 2D interpolate (lat, lon) irradiance of the satellite data to the ship position
Regular grid interpolate > Find out if its a regular grid
- Averaged to hourly data

-----------------

- Sonar data (adcp) = Correlate levels of cytoplankton
- Ask for paper on this
